**gapxplore** is a small R package for *ETC5523: Communicating with Data*.
It bundles a polished Shiny app and tidy Gapminder datasets so users can
explore continent trends, compare values at a given year, and examine
country-level patterns.

## Installation

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ETC5523-2025/assignment-4-packages-and-shiny-apps-MidhunUnnikrishnan7")
```

## Launch the app

```r
library(gapxplore)
run_app()
```

## What’s included?

- `gm_panel` — country–year panel (1952–2007, every 5 years)  
- `gm_trends` — continent–year aggregates (means/totals)  
- `gm_summary` — latest-year snapshot by country

The app presents three complementary views:

- **Trends (by continent):** lines for continent-level means/totals across the selected years.  
- **Bubble (countries):** one year; x = GDP per capita (log option), y = life expectancy, size = population (millions), colour = continent.  
- **Compare (bar @ year):** ranks continents at a single year for the chosen metric.
